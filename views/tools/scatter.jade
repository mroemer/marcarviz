        p Scatter plots display the concordance or disconcordance of gene expression in two conditions. Typically, the x-axis
            | shows the log
            sub 2
            | (fold changes) observed for the first condition and the y-axis shows the log
            sub 2
            | (fold changes) observed for the second condition. Linear regression is performed to assess the concordance of 
            | the observed changes in gene expression. The regression line is included in the scatter plot.
