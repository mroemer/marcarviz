        h3 About this tool
        p This tool generates volcano plots. Volcano plots show effect strength and significance simultaneously. For gene expression data, typically the 
            | ordinate (y-axis) shows -log
            sub 10
            | (p-values) and the abcissa (x-axis) shows the log
            sub 2
            | (fold changes). Significant genes are represented by points in the upper corners of the plot. Volcano plots can
            | be used to quickly assess the number of differentially expressed genes.

                .help-block Set the threshold for differential regulation. A log2(Fold Change) of 1 corresponds to 2-fold up- or down-regulation.
